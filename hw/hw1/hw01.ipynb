Put your homework submission files (Jupyter notebook `.ipynb`, html converted from notebook, `Project.toml`, all code and data set to reproduce results) in the `master` branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. After each homework due date, teaching assistant and instructor will check out your `master` branch for grading. Tag each of your homework submissions with tag names `hw1`, `hw2`, ...  Tagging time will be your submission time. That means if you tag your hw1 submission after deadline, penalty points will be deducted for late submission.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Read the [style guide](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle) for Julia programming. Following rules in the style guide will be strictly enforced when grading: (1) four space indenting rule, (2) 92 charcter rule, (3) space after comma rule, (4) no space before comma rule, (5) space around binary operator rule."
