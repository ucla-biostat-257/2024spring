* Homework 4 due 5/17 @ 11:59PM.

## Today

* Eigen-decomposition and SVD.

* Numerical optimization intro.

## Q&A

* Cannot modify content of a `struct`? Load Revise.jl in the beginning of Jupyter notebook.

* HW3 cannot achieve x1000 speedup? Tips: Woodbury formula, precompute sufficient statistics, careful coding (BLAS, LAPACK).

* Typo corrected in [HW4](https://ucla-biostat-257.github.io/2024spring/hw/hw4/hw04.html).
